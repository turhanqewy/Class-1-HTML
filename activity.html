<h1>The Cow</h1>
<p>Cows are domesticated herbivorous mammals known for their gentle nature and vital role in agriculture. As members of the species Bos taurus, they are primarily raised for milk, meat, and leather. Cows have a complex digestive system with four stomach compartments that help them break down tough plant material like grass. They are social animals with strong herd bonds, and studies show they can form friendships and feel stress when separated. <br> <br>Dairy cows produce large quantities of milk daily, while beef cows are bred for muscle and meat quality. Across various cultures, especially in India, cows hold spiritual significance and are often revered. Intelligent and emotionally aware, cows communicate through moos and body language, making them far more fascinating than many realize.</p>
